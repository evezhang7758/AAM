# Explanation:

# Each vertiport has a unique ID number, which can be used to identify a vertiport based on the VertiportMap.

# At the initial stage, each vertiport is equipped with 5 stages, 5 eVTOLs, 1 pad for takeoff, and 1 pad for landing.

# The reason why Takeoff and Landing Pads (TLOF) are divided into two parts is to reduce the possibility of multiple eVTOLs attempting to use the same TLOF.

# waitMap records passengers who wait for more than 5 minutes and have requested an evtol from depot.
