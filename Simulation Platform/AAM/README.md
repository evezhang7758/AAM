The simulation platform adopts an agent-based approach, comprising four key agents: Vertiport, eVTOL, User and Depot (refer to Figure 1). 
Each agent contains fixed inputs and stochastic variables that are essential for the simulation process. 
Fixed inputs are input data provided before the start of the simulation and will not change during the simulation process 
while the stochastic variables are those that vary during the simulation process as intermedium results.
